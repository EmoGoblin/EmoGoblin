- 👋 Hi, I’m @EmoGoblin
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, plants, animals, cozy & creative activities
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bunch of programming languages to change my career and become a Full-stack Engineer (to leave France) and also build my first video game on my spare time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CSS, JS and a bit HTML, and probably CPP and Python at some point.
- 📫 How to reach me : Find me on instagram @mach.cham
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Madam/Goddess/Supreme/Your Honor/Your Majesty the Queen
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm trying to understand technologies and programmation a little bit better so when the robots & AI decide to attack us, I will be able to destroy them. Also, I needed an excuse to be more on my laptop.
